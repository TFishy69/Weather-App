# Tfish's Weather App
- This weather app pulls an API from openweather, which tells the user what the current weather conditions/details are of the inputted city.
- Tells the user 24 weather conditions of said city.
- The final goal is to implement some AI to prompt it questions about the weather and refering it to the city.

Learning outcomes:
- Understand how API's work and how to access them
- How to modify HTML with API's to theoretically do what I want in the future of web building.

What is finished?

- Commenting
- Basic App
- Humidity added

2. Implement custom weather icons (almost done)
2. Check API if it offers more weather details (if so add them)
3. Make it look good
4. Add transition effects


Final:
1. Chat box
2. openAI API that accepts pre determined inputs based on city.
